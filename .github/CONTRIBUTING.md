# Contributing to X Bot Blocker

🚀 Thank you for your interest in improving X Bot Blocker! To maintain quality and security, we have some guidelines for contributions.

## 💡 Submitting Issues
- Before submitting a bug report, check if the issue already exists.
- Feature requests should include a clear **use case** and **potential solutions**.
- Use **descriptive titles** when opening new issues.

## 🛠 Pull Requests (PRs)
✅ **DO:**
- Fork the repo & create a new branch (`feature-branch`).
- Follow the project's existing code style.
- Write clear commit messages.
- Ensure your code doesn’t expose API keys or security flaws.

❌ **DON'T:**
- Submit PRs directly to `main`—use feature branches.
- Change core bot logic without approval (open an issue first).
- Add hardcoded credentials or environment variables.

## 🔒 Security Practices
- **DO NOT** commit `.env` files or API keys.
- Use GitHub Secrets for storing sensitive data.
- Follow rate limits to avoid getting blocked by X API.

📢 We reserve the right to reject any contributions that don’t align with project goals.
